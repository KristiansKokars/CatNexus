# Cat Nexus

Cat Nexus is a modern built Android app to scroll through an infinite list of cat pictures and download your favourites.

It was originally created to teach new students the basics of Android development in a fun way, and has been polished up for release on Google Play Store to gain experience on that part of the application lifecycle.
